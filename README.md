# Accenture-Virtual-Intern

## Context
You’ve been assigned to a new project and the first thing you must do is get up to speed with the business problem that this project is tackling, the requirements that need to be fulfilled as deliverables and the alignment of internal teams with the client.

You will be working within a large team at Accenture and there will be several people on your team doing different roles to make this project a success

### Task 1
- Understand the client and business problem at hand.
- Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
- Identify which tasks you should focus on.

### Task 2

##### Requirements gathering
- You should take time to fully understand the data model and how the tables link together. Then you should think about which tables are most relevant.
##### Data cleaning
- Before we begin to work with the relevant data sets, we’ll need to ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis.
Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data. This includes removing columns that have a high number of missing values,
removing rows that have values which are erroneous, changing the data type of some values within a column and also removing columns which are not relevant to this task. 
##### Data modeling
- Finally, use this knowledge to create a final data set containing all of the columns that you will need to complete the task.
You can use Excel or any other tool of your choice to create your final data set. Based on which columns you think will be most useful,
you may be required to merge tables together by using the Unique Keys within tables.
